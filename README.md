<h2> Password Generator Challenge </h2>  

This challenge explores cobinign functions in JavaScript, using defined variables and linking HTML elements to display the generated password in the text box - including checkboxes and form validation.
Considering the project is constantly in progress, it allows me to keep revisiting and comparing my own progress whilst I learn more and become more comforable/fluent in working with JavaScript.
